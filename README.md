# piscine42

This is where it all started... The 42 Piscine experience !
These are the first coding exercices I did during the 42 piscine.

## What is it ?

42 aims at challenging the candidates on their ability to give their best during their Piscine. Rather than offering an introductory course in computer science, 42's Piscine starts the curriculum with an intensive learning of the first language used during the course, C. In one month, it allows you to discover all the learning methods of the training: **peer-to-peer learning**, **group work**, **peer-evaluations** or **project-based teaching**.
